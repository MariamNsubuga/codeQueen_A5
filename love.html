                    In this type, the levels of passion and physical intimacy are high. Desire, physical attraction, physical appearance, and romance are given top priority.

                            Love is merely a madness; and, I tell you, deserves as well a dark house and a whip as madmen do; and the reason why they are not so punish’d and cured is that the lunacy is so ordinary that the whippers are in love too.

                    Agape (pronounced as A-GAH-pey) in Greek, is considered to be the purest form of love.
                    It promotes brotherly affection and love for each other. 
                    In fact, it is exactly what all religions have been trying to teach us. It is basically love for all around us; to possess a compassionate heart.

                <content>
                    People who have a tendency of giving up on relationships as soon as the initial euphoria is over, are said to be in a Ludus form of love.
                    A ludus lover does not work toward a long-term commitment, and senses a form of thrill only in the initial days of the relationship.

                <content>
                    As the name suggests, this is the worst form of love.
                    It is full of extreme reactions like insecurity, jealousy, obsession, compulsion, and unrealistic demands.
                    While a partner may feel important initially―given that his/her partner is so dedicated to him/her―the truth is far from different. 
                    Breaking away from such a relationship is equally difficult; do it NOW.
